# matlab-style-guide

Collection of proposed MATLAB style guides, naming conventions, and recommendations.

## Background

Each program generally has set standard for coding stlye and naming conventions. However, **MATLAB does not** have an established company or community standard. There have been efforts to develop and agree on a standard, like [PEP8][pep8-style], but some of these resources are conflicting and are scattered across websites and forums.

Here, I hope to maintain a library of resources and recommendations to

1. Easily find relevant information regarding style and naming conventions
2. Propose or develop a community-agreed standard

Additional background information can be found [here](#additional-background).

## Style-Guide

Briefly, most of the previously developed style guides and naming convention documents are inspired by the same 2 or 3 sources.

- [MATLAB Style 2.0][matlab-style-2.0]
- [Elements of MATLAB Style][elements-matlab-style] with [updates][elements-matlab-style-updates]
- [MATLAB Programming Style Guide][programming-style-guide]

For more downloadable or linked resources, see [Resources](#resources).

### Proposed

A complete proposed style-guide can be found [here][proposed-style-guide] - Do not want to bore with all the details upfront :)
